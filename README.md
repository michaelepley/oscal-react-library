# Easy Dynamics OSCAL React Library

OSCAL React Library provides components and a sample application for browsing and interacting
with [OSCAL](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL) data. The components are reusable in any react
application and the sample application allows browsing OSCAL data, including System Security Plans,
Catalogs, and Components.

## Getting Started

### Library

TODO: Provide a description of the library more specifically and its benefits

#### Installation

Use the [Node package manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/) to install `oscal-react-library` in your project.

```
npm install oscal-react-library
```

#### Usage

TODO: Provide an example of using one of the components (or something else that we provide).

#### Testing

The project tests can be executed by first running `npm install` to ensure that all the required dependencies
are installed, then running the test suite with `npm run test`.  Also validate that the code passes
the eslint linting requirements by running `npm run lint`.

### OSCAL Viewer (sample application)

The OSCAL Viewer sample application is provided both as an example of using the components and as
a tool to view the various OSCAL concepts, such as catalogs, system securty plans, and components.

#### Running

Within the `example/src` directory, execute:

```
npm install
npm start
```

#### Testing

Within the `example/src` directory, run the same commands used to test the library itself:

```
npm install
npm run test
npm run lint
```
